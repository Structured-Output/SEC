15,171,970 4,000 0 0
In
connection with this vote, the holders of 3,782,869 shares of common stock of the Company exercised their right to convert their
shares into cash at a conversion price of approximately $10.22 per share, for an aggregate conversion amount of approximately
$38.7 million.
Following
the Meeting, the Company filed the amendment to the charter with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
Additionally,
in connection with the approval of the Extension, on January 3, 2020, certain individuals and entities (the “Contributors”)
that participated in the private placement of units that occurred simultaneously with the Company’s initial public offering
contributed to the Company an aggregate amount of $781,699.17, representing contributions covering a prorated amount of $0.02
per unconverted public share for the partial month of January 2020 and $0.025 per unconverted public share for each of February
2020 and March 2020 (each, a “Contribution”).
Following
the Meeting and filing of the amendment to the charter, the Company deposited $223,342.62, the Contribution for January 2020,
into the trust account established in connection with the Company’s initial public offering. The Company will deposit the
second Contribution on or before January 31, 2020, and will deposit the third Contribution on or before February 29, 2020, in
each case, to the same trust account; provided that any such additional Contribution will only be made if the previously announced
merger agreement with TGI Fridays is still then in effect, or, if such agreement is earlier terminated, the Board of Directors
of the Company by majority vote determines to require such additional Contribution. If the Board of Directors determines not to
require such additional Contribution, the Company will proceed to liquidate its assets and distribute the remaining amounts in
the trust account to the then holders of public shares.
The
Contributions will not bear any interest and will be repayable by the Company to the Contributors upon consummation of an initial
business combination. The Contributions will be forgiven if the Company is unable to consummate an initial business combination
except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Company’s trust account.

On January 9, 2020, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). At the Special Meeting, the holders of a majority of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote approved amendments to the Company’s certificate of incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), to effect a reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”), followed immediately by a forward stock split of the Company’s common stock (the “Forward Stock Split,” and together with the Reverse Stock Split, the “Stock Splits”), at a ratio (i) not less than 1-for-5 and not greater than 1-for-100, in the case of the Reverse Stock Split, and (ii) not less than 5-for-1 and not greater than 100-for-1, in the case of the Forward Stock Split. The amendments were approved with (i) 11,225,127 shares of common stock voting in favor of the Reverse Stock Split, 2,480,798 shares voting against the Reverse Stock Split and 680 shares abstaining, and (ii) 11,212,686 shares of common stock voting in favor of the Forward Stock Split, 2,493,249 shares voting against the Forward Stock Split and 670 shares abstaining.
The exact stock split ratios will be set within the ranges described above at the discretion of the Board (and, in all cases, with the forward stock split ratio being the inverse of the reverse stock split ratio). The Board will evaluate updated ownership data impacting the various stock split ratios so that it can determine the aggregate costs of the stock splits within the range of stock split ratios before choosing the stock split ratios. After determining the appropriate stock split ratios, the Board will direct the Company to file with the State of Delaware certificates of amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effectuate the Stock Splits. At this time, the Company believes that any reverse stock split ratio within the approved ranges would reduce the number of record holders below 300, which is the level at or above which the Company is required to file reports with the SEC.
